        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">Hey Chris — </p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">I’m excited to have you as a finalist for the internship.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">I’ve attached the final project below.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">I’m looking forward to seeing your work!</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">RD</p>
        <h4 class="__article__list__title f4">Final Project 📝</h4>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Congratulations on reaching the final stage of the interview process for our internship. Out of nearly 400 candidates, you’re among the top 5. For this final stage, I’d like you to execute on the project outlined below. Prioritize quality over speed, but know that speed will be taken into account. It should take no more than 72 hours, and I anticipate it being 2-3 hours of work.</p>
        <h4 class="__article__list__title f4">Deck 🖼</h4>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Create a deck for a deal, partnership, or something else entirely that you’d like to work on while at Omni. You should assume all real world variables will be in play, including format / content / copy / design / etc. <br> <br>This deck could be sent ahead before a meeting via email, and then potentially gone over in person during the meeting. The precise content and direction of the deck is up to you — your goal should be to create a scenario that represents tremendous value for Omni, and a deck that gives us the best shot of a meeting (or next steps) to capture that value.</p>
        <h4 class="__article__list__title f4">Email Sequence 📬</h4>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Create a cold email sequence for folks you’d like to reach out to during your time at Omni. Again, there’s flexibility on both the audience and the content — but it should be something you’d be excited about and that would create value for Omni. This could tie into the scenario for the deck you built, or something else entirely. <br><br> Envision that emails could be sent manually by you, or you could use a more automated solution to send the initial emails and the follow up(s). Your goal should be to maximize the chance of a response by succinctly communicating the value and magic of Omni.</p>

        <p class="__article__text__small f5 f4-ns"><span class="b">- Crossfitter 💪:</span> Omni needs an on-demand athlete to own growth challenges after the 2.0 product release. As the right-hand associate to Robert Gurney Architect, I routinely fought fires of diverse scope within three hour deadlines. Continuing the athlete analogy – I'm trained as a crossfitter.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__small f5 f4-ns"><span class="b">- Triathlete 🎽:</span> Omni needs an all-in-one operator to ensure successful outcomes for customers by helping them leverage Omni for their specific context. I propose combining my varied skillset towards multiplying referrals from the travel, real estate and home improvement industries. This highly iterative campaign would concentrate content strategy, business development and product in one feedback loop. → <a  class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="#referrals">Read more about Omni's referral streams</a></p>

        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">Ryan,</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">Quick summary about my input/output to share with the team before our call (1pm Wed.) — Omni’s gain, what I’ll ship, and why I’m the best operator to do it. View below for the full context.</p>
        <h4 class="__article__list__title f4">Benefit ✨ — Better Referral Multipliers</h4>
        <ul class="__article__list__container pl4 pl5-l ml0 ml1-l bl b--black-10">
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3">Omni gains referral streams from the travel, real estate, and home improvement industries that multiply and convert new customers better than consumer word-of-mouth. </li>
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3">Local businesses position Omni in the bigger picture they paint about value for their own customer base. </li>
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3">From this position, Omni can scale consumer sales faster in new regions and validate traction for larger partner deals with brands like Airbnb, Zillow, and Buildzoom.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="__article__list__title f4">Execution 🛠 — Air and ground cover for local businesses </h4>
        <ul class="__article__list__container pl4 pl5-l ml0 ml1-l bl b--black-10">
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3">What I envision shipping for Omni in 12 weeks is 60 referral streams that convert 30 of their clients per year into $100 monthly Omni customers – $2MM/year.</li>
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3">With limited footprint on Omni’s existing team resources, I’ll cycle between targeted content creation and customer pursuit – treating marketing and sales as a product owner. </li>
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3">Leading with value first as my air cover, I’ll get on the ground with local businesses to understand the conversations they’re having with their clients, and iterate how to position Omni at scale in a way that converts for us and for our referral streams.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="__article__list__title f4 ">Ownership ⭐️ — All-in-one hire </h4>
        <ul class="__article__list__container pl4 pl5-l ml0 ml1-l bl b--black-10">
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3"><span class="bb b--black-50 bw1">Full business picture</span> — As a business owner, I sell what I build and touch every piece of the execution scope. Yet as a consultant, my business also depends on plugging into larger organizations within market dynamics. This tension builds the resourcefulness and empathy needed to market and sell Omni to referral streams and their own customers.</li>
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3"><span class="bb b--black-50 bw1">Architecture background</span> — I have an unfair understanding of the spatial problems that contractors, real estate agents, and the hospitality industry are discussing with their customers. These industries are exposed to a lot of market noise, which is why customers hire them. Omni can solve their problems, and I can reach them.</li>
          <li class="__article__list__item f5 f4-ns pb3"><span class="bb b--black-50 bw1">Sales/Design background</span> — You can't just jump cold into a real conversation with an owner about their business. You lead with value and warm the pipeline between listening and staging action. At Omni, I’ll leverage my design skill set to create targeted marketing content that adds actionable value to each industry, and that plugs into the bigger storytelling context they paint for their customers. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="__article__text__small f5 f4-ns">Looking forward to our conversation and to meet more of the team.</p>

      <div class="__article__text__container pr3 pr5-m pr6-l">
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f4-m f3-l">Ryan,</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f4-m f3-l">Thank you for your time during today's call. I enjoyed speaking with you about the open-ended nature of the internship.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f5 f4-m f3-l">Where I can make a big difference at Omni is by targeting customers with high network value. See below for three examples. Certain individuals are a conduit to many consumers, but they need special support to put their reputation behind referrals, and to make them effective. My strength is in creating the evidence necessary to sell. → <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bw1 bb no-underline dim" href="https://twitter.com/delk/status/829055088719122432">It's how I upped the ante on applications for Omni</a>, moved client decisions forward about what to build as an architect, cornered the market for 16 weeks at SOM Chicago, and sold tickets to shows in high school so promoters would continue to book my band.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f5 f4-m f3-l pb4">Content strategy and BD need to be married. Otherwise, sales will spin its wheels scraping for low-hanging fruit with no value in hand, and content will be spammy stock photography that's only engaging hashtag bots. This would be a fourth tier for Omni's business development – an ongoing campaign involving both pursuit and content creation.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">✈️ Influencers in LA, NYC and Chicago that regularly commute to SF and Boston  </p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Your wardrobe across the country. Skip the bags, everything's at the hotel. Omni profiles celebrities and executives that travel to SF or Boston regularly. They don't want to pack a thing. Just their phone. They pick out what they want on Omni and it's ready when they get there. This sets up a story that hotels, airlines, Uber, and Airbnb can get behind, and builds a press worthy trend piece. Omni has an opportunity to complete that picture. </p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">🏠 Real Estate Agents</p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Omni is luxury storage. Closet space is an objection in property sales, especially for families downsizing from villas to urban condos. Realtors want to be a resource to clients for all things luxury, but are short on quality storage providers, other than professional organizers and cabinet makers. Collaborate with the agents helping families move back into the city and feature how their urban lifestyle was enabled by Omni.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">👷 Contractors</p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">When I worked in architecture, two wealthy clients foolishly stored valuable belongings in the basement during renovations. As you can imagine, theft was inevitable. It caused huge pain on the projects, and especially on the contractors. Lots of clients are defiant about keeping their home life intact, despite construction. It poses high risk to contractors, and in construction, it's far better to ensure an outcome than to risk litigation. I can help Omni equip contractors with the story clients will say yes to.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__small f5 f4-ns">I appreciate your consideration and hope to speak further with you and the team.</p>

        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">Ryan, <br> <br>In preparation for our call, I mocked-up a few ideas for how Omni can improve the inbound funnel before this summer.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l pb4">→ <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bw1 bb no-underline pb1 dim" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n1xq1h5g07jhd0d/AABmvgQlh-vl-AV_UN7sakefa?dl=0">View Video and Mock-Ups</a></p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">1. Before the footer, add a Call to Action ⬇️</p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Right now, it’s a dead end. Omni needs a Subscribe or Download on the App Store target. You can especially tell it’s missing if you find yourself clicking on the buttons with the images of the stored items.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">2. Add Benefits ✨ between the Video and Features section</p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">After the video, I see the Omni features, not the gains in my life. What’s life like with Omni, not as a product user, but as a satisfied customer? The video shows Penelope’s living room before and after, but not side-by-side. Make that big for the users not clicking on the video. Add a Benefits section before the Features.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">3. After Pricing, add a Plan your First Pickup section 🚚</p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">I fear my storage costs getting irrationally high, and I don’t understand how accessible the pickup/delivery service is. Help me visualize the courier timeline and costs so that I don’t use the service in a way that I’ll regret later. Even though Omni helps people get their life together, that’s usually when people get serious about budgeting. Help me plan. Give me ideas. Show me the process. This should lead users to two targets: Get started or Learn More (sends users to Omni’s content strategy).</p>
        <p class="__article__text__subhead f4 b pb2">4. Create more content that positions Omni as the natural next step 🏁</p>
        <p class="__article__text__indent f5 f4-ns pb3 pl3 pl5-l bl b--black-10">Always give value before you transact. Build the context where Omni makes perfect sense by creating useful guides, capturing customer stories, and partnering with home-related content creators. What can I do with all that extra space? What’s the extended story about how Penelope’s life improved, even after 6 months? What common, inspiring, funny, or heart-warming stories are hiding in 99 other customer experiences? How can Omni give guest contributors like <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="http://minimaonline.com/About">Minima</a>, <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="https://www.containerstore.com/tips/index.htm">Container Store</a>, or <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308">Marie Kondo</a> a unique channel to share content?</p>

        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">Hi Ryan,</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f4 f3-l">Your internship sounds more like a right-hand position. I'm interested. For one and a half years, I worked for the most highly awarded Architect in Washington, DC, in a similar capacity. Since then, I've been building a business background from scratch, teaching myself how to sell and ship value directly in the market. It's hard, but I love it (especially BD), and now I want to work with a team that can make a big difference in people's lives.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f5 f4-m f3-l">My mom is a border-line hoarder and I'm a minimalist architect obsessed with business. I've thought a lot about what Omni is building. I've thought about launching a similar service -- called Boxspector -- with imagery of mining through the junk we hold onto because we know gems are hidden inside. It causes so much family strife because everyone else wants to toss it. However, after flipping thrift store items on Craigslist and eBay because I ran out of money, I know how much value can be mined from in our storage.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f5 f4-m f3-l">Here's a similar home-related project – real estate as pop up furniture stores – that I tested after making the switch from architecture: → <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="http://morganhyland.com/topoi">morganhyland.com/topoi</a></p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f5 f4-m f3-l">Starting this summer would enable me to see my current contracts to completion. Right now, I consult for small design-based businesses, such as building websites for Swedish architects, or helping a senior care physical trainer bring a high quality furniture line for seniors to market. You can see my past work here: → <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="http://morganhyland.com">morganhyland.com</a>, and my resume here: → <a target="_blank" class="blue b--blue bb bw1 no-underline dim" href="http://soakinsoap.com">soakinsoap.com</a>.</p>
        <p class="__article__text__large f5 f4-m f3-l">I would love to hear about your background and share more about mine.</p>
